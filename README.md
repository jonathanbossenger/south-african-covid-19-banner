# RSA Covid-19 Banner

This plugin makes it easy for South African WordPress sites to add the Covid-19 banner as required by the South African government. This is to make sure that a legitimate source of information is known.

There is a widget that can be used in sidebars and a shortcode that can be used pretty much anywhere else.
